# Welcome to IMMERSIVE ZONE 

## Project Overview 

The Immersive Zone app is an augmented reality (AR) app that allows users to scan an area and generate a 3D model of that space. Once the space has been scanned, users can place virtual furniture in the 3D model to see how it would look in the real space. The end product is a realistic AR experience that allows users to visualize furniture in their space through the lens of their iPhone camera.

## Goal

The goal of the Immersive Zone app is to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to visualize furniture in their space. By using AR technology, the app allows users to see how different furniture options would look in their space when it comes to staging a house for sell. <br>

This helps realtors save operating expenses with different furnitures staging styles, and buyers make informed buying decisions. 

## Objectives

To create an AR app that allows users to scan an area and generate a 3D model of that space. <br>
To allow users to place virtual furniture in the 3D model and see how it would look in the real space.<br>
To provide users with a realistic AR experience that allows them to visualize furniture in their space through the lens of their iPhone camera.<br>
To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to scan and place furniture in their space.<br>
To optimize the app for performance and provide a seamless AR experience on iOS devices.<br>

Welcome to the Immersive Zone for iOS! This app utilizes the Vuforia Engine to scan area targets and generate 3D models using Unity. 

## Getting Started

Immersive Zone is designed to run on iOS devices and has been tested on the following versions of iOS: <br>
iOS 14.0 <br>
iOS 13.7 <br>
iOS 13.6 <br>

To get started with the Immersive Zone, you'll need an iOS device running one of the supported versions of iOS, as well as an designated area target to scan.

Download and install the latest version of: <br>
- Vuforia Engine SDK: https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/SDK <br>
- Area Target Scan by Vufuria on App Store: https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/tool/areatargetscan
- Unity V3.41: https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.dmg?_ga=2.8552242.685981396.1671474123-683382588.1670537005&_gac=1.257148537.1670537413.CjwKCAiAs8acBhA1EiwAgRFdwzvzyI8PZSCW5HUs26FCPkmMS6YQiTg7s8YPAP__Mubr37puxH1O6BoCy5EQAvD_BwE <br>


## Instructions

- Open AreaTargetScan and allow it to access your device's camera when prompted. <br>
- Scan the area under 5 minutes to avoid crashing <br> 
- Hold your device steady and scan the area target by holding it up to the target and waiting for the app to process the scan. You can find the target image in the targets folder of this repository. <br>
- Once the app has finished processing the scan, it will generate a 3D model on your screen. <br>
- Explore the 3D model by moving your device around and zooming in and out.<br>
- Share the 3D model and import the package into unity (ensure your unity have installed Vuforia Engine) <br>
- Once the targetscan is in Unity, you can start placing furnitures or any items that you want buyers to see <br>

## Tips and Tricks

- Make sure you have sufficient lighting when scanning the area target.<br>
- Have at least 20GB available on your storage <br>
- Hold your device steady and move slowly to get the best scan results.<br>
- If the app is having trouble generating the 3D model, try moving your device around and scanning different areas of the target.<br>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Immersive Zone, please don't hesitate to open an issue on our GitHub repository. We'll do our best to help you out and improve the app.
